== TO - DO ==

*modify games views/controllers to allow the adding of prisoners
*make sure I have good validates, and get appropriate error messages

*user label tags where appropriate
*add some user attributes, like gender, or severity of crime, use proper form helpers

*have a think about CSRF and escaping of input

Further study
