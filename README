== PrisonerDilemma ==

A simple implementation of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma problem



== TO - DO ==

*authentication
**set up an access controller
**set everyone's password to "test" but with different salt
**set up some login views
**put filters in appropriate places
** add password to the edit and create prisoner forms



*BUG - when submitting three names it doesn't complain :(

*modify games views/controllers to allow the adding of prisoners
*make sure I have good validates, and get appropriate error messages
*pull out form and put it in a partial
*user label tags where appropriate
*add some user attributes, like gender, or severity of crime, use proper form helpers

*have a think about CSRF and escaping of input

*convert the plead guilty/non-guilty to a form rather than two links

*add user authentication

*separate admin from regular play


Further study
*study and improve with CSS
*study and improve with jQuery
*make a mobile version???














== DONE (sorted by date in descending order) ==
**set up a virtual attribute, "password"

**added attribute protection
**set up some convenient salting and hashing functions

**migrate Users to have fields necessary for user authentication, put in separate migration

*Add links "modify pris" and "modify games" so you can go anywhere
*Feb 23 2012

*decided to store game/player information in URL

* change display play_game based on game state

* get plead guilty to update database successfully

* fix things so that you see only games that belong to a certain user

* is there a better way to relate two players to a game without order?
** how do relationships work in this situation?
